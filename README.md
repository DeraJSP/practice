# GIT TASK

**1.	Explain version control**  
This is a way of tracking code modifications and coordinating changes to software code and design.

**2. 	Explain difference between git and github**  
Git is a version control software installed locally on a system and is used to manage repositories.
Github is cloud-based service used to host git repositories and collaborate with other developers.

**3.	List 3 other github alternatives**

- OneDev  
- Codeberg  
 
**4.	Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull**  
	git fetch is used to fetch all changes from the remote repository to the local repository without making changes to the current working directory.
	git pull brings a local branch up-to-date with its remote version. It automatically merges the changes into the current working directory.

**5.	Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it**  
	Git rebase is the process of changing the base of the developer's branch from one commit to another, so it looks like they have created their branch from a different commit.  
	`git rebase <base>` is the command that performs the standard rebase.

**6.	Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it**  
	Git cherry-pick means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another. It applies the changes introduced by one or more existing commits onto another branch.  
	`git cherry-pick <commit>` is the command.
