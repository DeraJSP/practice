# GIT TASK

**1. Explain version control**
	This is a way of tracking code modifications and coordinating changes to software code and design.
 
**2. 	Explain difference between git and github**  
	Git is a version control software installed locally on a system and is used to manage repositories.  
	Github is cloud-based service used to host git repositories and collaborate with other developers.

**3.	List 3 other github alternatives**  
- Bitbucket  
- OneDev  
- Codeberg  
 
**4.	Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull**  
	git fetch is used to fetch all changes from the remote repository to the local repository without making changes to the current working directory.  
	git pull brings a local branch up-to-date with its remote version. It automatically merges the changes into the current working directory.

**5.	Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it**  
	Git rebase is the process of changing the base of the developer's branch from one commit to another, so it looks like they have created their branch from a different commit.  
	`git rebase <base>` is the command that performs the standard rebase.

**6.	Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it**  
	Git cherry-pick means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another. It applies the changes introduced by one or more existing commits onto another branch.  
	`git cherry-pick <commit>` is the command.

 1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
